DemolisherScales-egg-spoil-seconds-override=Demolisher egg spoilage time (seconds)

[mod-setting-description]
DemolisherScales-scale-drop-multiplier=Multiplies the number of scales dropped by all demolishers. When this is set to 1, small demolishers give around 10 scales, medium ones give around 20, big ones give 80, and behemoths give 400. Each scale can be made into one big miner. If you set this to 2, you will get double the scales, so you can make twice as many miners. You can set this to a value like 0.5 to reduce drops.
DemolisherScales-mark-deconstruction=If enabled, when a demolisher dies, its corpse boulders will be marked for deconstruction automatically. This is useful for automated farming of demolishers.
DemolisherScales-egg-spoil-seconds-override=Changes the spoil time of demolisher eggs, but only if another mod adds demolisher eggs to the game. Set to 0 to not change the time.
